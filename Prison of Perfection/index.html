			              PERFECTION: <br>
                          THE CONDITION STATE OR QUALITY OF BEING FREE OF ALL FLAWSOR DEFECTS.<br>
                          I THINK THE ACTUAL DEFINITION SHOULD BE:<br>
                          A TEN LETTER WORK DESCRIBING SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST OR,PRISON. <br>
						  MAYBE STRAIGHT-JACKET.<br>
                        <br>
						<br>
                          SEE PERFECTION, IS A VIRUS, A TUMOR, A GROWTH, IT<br>
                          INFECTS THE MIND OF WHO ATTACHES ITSELF TO,<br>
                          UNTIL IT EVENTUALLY, DESTROYS THE HOST.<br>
                        <br>
						<br>
                          I HATE THE VERY WORD PERFECTION.<br>
                          IT HAS DRIVEN ME CRAZY FOR YEARS GUIDED BY FEAR,<br>
                          I WAS CONSTANTLY COMPARING MY SELF TO MY PEERS,<br>
                          STRESSING AND STRIVING TO REACH SOME IDEA THAT ONLY EXISTED, IN HERE.<br>
                        <br>
						<br>
                          OH, YOU THOUGHT PERFECTION WAS REAL?<br>
                          WELL, I DISAGREE.<br>
                          I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A PERFECT TREE?<br>
                          IN REAL LIFE HAVE YOU EVER GONE INTO A FOREST AND SEEN A PERFECT TREE?<br>
                          NAH SEE THEY ALL GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING GOING ON,<br>
                          SOME LEAN THIS WAY SOME LEAN THAT WAY,<br>
                          SOME HAVE A LITTLE TOO MUCH LOSS<br>
                          AND SOME GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF BARK THAT'S BEEN RIPPED OFF. . .<br>
                          BUT SOMEHOW, THEY ARE ALL BEAUTIFUL.<br>
                        <br>
						<br>
                          BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE WE DON'T SEEM TO SEE THAT WE,<br>
                          ARE ALL BEAUTIFUL, IN ALL OF OUR EXPRESSION.<br>
                          SO WE DISSECT OURSELVES INTO PIECES,<br>
                          JUDGING EACH OTHER THINKING PERFECTION IS SOMETHING WE CAN ACHIEVE,<br>
						  WHICH LEADS US TO FEELING DEPLETED AND DEFEATED BUT SALVADOR DALI'S SAID IT BEST:<br>
                          "HAVE NO FEAR OF PERFECTION BECAUSE, YOU NEVER REACH IT"<br>
                        <br>
						<br>
                          LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, THERE ARE TWO DOORS IN LIFE.<br>
                          DOOR NUMBER ONE: BE PERFECT AND BE ADMIRED,<br>
                          OR DOOR NUMBER TWO: BE REAL, AND BE LOVED.<br>
                          I SAY CHOOSE NUMBER TWO, AND CHOOSE IT QUICK<br>
                          BECAUSE LIFE'S TOO SHORT TO TRY TO LIVE UP TO SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST, IT MAKES NO SENSE.<br>
                         <br>
						 <br>
						  SO PLEASE CREATE YOUR OWN UNIQUE EXPRESSION,COLOR OUTSIDE THE LINES,<br>
                          BE THE PRETZEL THAT REFUSES TO NOT,<br>
                          BE THE MARBEL THAT DOESN'T QUIT ROLL RIGHT,<br>
                          DO THE DANCE THAT NOBODY'S EVER SEEN BEFORE<br>
                          AND DON'T WORRY IF PEOPLE STOP AND STARE.<br>
                          I MEAN IF THE LEANING TOWER OF PISA WAS STRAIGHT,
                          NOBODY WOULD CARE.<br>
                        <br>
						<br>
                          SEE WHEN MISTAKES ARE MADE BEAUTY IS BIRTHED.<br>
                          YOU KNOW WHY THEY CALL IT THE MODEL T?<br>
                          BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MANY LETTERS IT TOOK FOR HENRY FORD TO GET THE DARN CAR TO WORK.<br>
                          SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT ALWAYS BEING FIRST AND GETTING IT RIGHT.<br>
                          I MEAN SONY'S VERY FIRST PRODUCT THEY EVER MADE,
                          IT COOKED RICE.<br>
                        <br>
						<br>
                          SO EMBRACE YOUR MISTAKES, THEY ARE TO BE SAVORED,<br>
						  FAILURE IS THE CONDIMENT THAT GIVES SUCCESS IT'S FLAVOR,<br>
						  AND TRUE SUCCESS IS BEING YOURSELF IN A WORLD THAT'S CONSTANTLY TRYING TO MAKE YOU SOMEONE ELSE.<br>
                        <br>
						<br>
                          YOU KNOW I WAS READING THE OTHER DAY, ABOUT A JAPANESE TRADITION CALLED KINSUGI.<br>
                          WHAT THEY DO IS, IF AN OBJECT BREAKS THEY FILL THE CRACKS WITH PURE GOLD <br>
						  BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT WHEN SOMETHING SUFFERS DAMAGE AND HAS A HISTORY, IT IS ALL THE MORE BEAUTIFUL.<br>
                        <br>
						<br>
                          SO I SAY LOVE YOUR CRACKS. YOU MAY CALL IT BROKENNESS BUT IT IS THE WAY YOUR LIGHT WILL SHINE THROUGH,<br>
                          AND IF YOU HAVE NO ONE IN YOUR CORNER,<br>
                          THEN CONSIDER ME YOUR SUPPORTER AND WE WILL SMILE TOGETHER,<br>
                          AS SOCIETY TRIES TO DIAGNOSE OUR GIFTS, AS DISORDERS.<br>
                        <br>
						<br>
                          YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A PERFECT PERSON WITH PERFECT MAKE UP,<br>
                          PERFECT SKILLS OR PERFECT BUILD,<br>
                          CAUSE THE TRUTH IS REAL PEOPLE AREN'T PERFECT,<br>
                          AND PERFECT PEOPLE AREN'T REAL.<br>
